    Biscuits that

00:00:00.250 → 00:00:02.292 [00:00:02.042] : SPEAKER_05
    Biscuits there, Martin. Here we go.

00:00:40.210 → 00:00:41.813 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_02
    It really stinks in here, doesn't it?

00:00:42.252 → 00:00:47.450 [00:00:05.197] : SPEAKER_11
    I'm still not sure about this, guys. He's a bit late for that now, isn't he? This place is actually safe.

00:00:48.766 → 00:00:49.762 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_02
    What's on your fire?

00:00:50.842 → 00:00:52.192 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_02
    I can do nothing.

00:00:55.162 → 00:00:57.524 [00:00:02.363] : SPEAKER_02
    Just needs a bit of fresh liquor paint.

00:00:58.469 → 00:00:59.077 [00:00:00.607] : SPEAKER_02
    They're fine.

00:01:26.043 → 00:01:26.887 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_02
    It's not neat.

00:01:27.967 → 00:01:29.080 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_11
    Who's Nick? Don't son.

00:01:30.076 → 00:01:30.532 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_11
    Right there.

00:01:31.308 → 00:01:33.299 [00:00:01.991] : SPEAKER_11
    You can see the way that it's going.

00:01:34.160 → 00:01:35.965 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_11
    You ain't doing too much now, mate.

00:01:36.961 → 00:01:39.239 [00:00:02.278] : SPEAKER_02
    I thought we died ages ago.

00:01:39.948 → 00:01:40.927 [00:00:00.979] : SPEAKER_11
    Don't look like him.

00:01:42.648 → 00:01:43.576 [00:00:00.928] : SPEAKER_11
    They're called a police.

00:01:44.470 → 00:01:45.888 [00:00:01.417] : SPEAKER_02
    I need this next door.

00:01:45.905 → 00:01:47.187 [00:00:01.282] : SPEAKER_11
    Then sort this mess out.

00:01:47.373 → 00:01:50.242 [00:00:02.869] : SPEAKER_02
    No, why would he be squatting if he's mum's only?

00:01:53.988 → 00:01:54.376 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_02
    No.

00:01:55.017 → 00:01:55.034 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_02
    you

00:01:55.034 → 00:01:55.051 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_11
    you

00:01:55.051 → 00:01:57.970 [00:00:02.919] : SPEAKER_02
    Stays, we did. No, this ain't right. Well, we can see that, Stays.

00:01:57.970 → 00:01:58.460 [00:00:00.489] : SPEAKER_11
    Come on.

00:01:58.460 → 00:02:00.434 [00:00:01.974] : SPEAKER_02
    Just don't do anything. I need to speak to Dott.

00:02:13.883 → 00:02:17.697 [00:00:03.814] : SPEAKER_06
    Okay, I think we all need to calm down. One of us?

00:02:17.832 → 00:02:23.182 [00:00:05.349] : SPEAKER_10
    It has to be. What are you talking about? It was here. Everything happened here. Peter, for goodness sake.

00:02:24.380 → 00:02:25.038 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_10
    She told you.

00:02:25.915 → 00:02:27.637 [00:00:01.721] : SPEAKER_10
    What? Lauren said she told you.

00:02:28.210 → 00:02:36.293 [00:00:08.083] : SPEAKER_10
    Oh, she didn't tell me. Not exactly. She gave me a card. What card? What did he say? It said that Lucy was killed in this house. I saw it must have been someone who was here.

00:02:37.272 → 00:02:38.048 [00:00:00.776] : SPEAKER_06
    Well, think about it.

00:02:39.415 → 00:02:41.187 [00:00:01.772] : SPEAKER_06
    I was only here in Cindy living here at the time.

00:02:43.870 → 00:02:44.714 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_05
    And niece.

00:02:45.676 → 00:02:46.992 [00:00:01.316] : SPEAKER_05
    She was living here then too.

00:02:48.443 → 00:02:49.507 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_05
    Look, I want to see this card.

00:02:49.540 → 00:02:50.333 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_10
    Never mind that.

00:02:51.076 → 00:02:51.953 [00:00:00.877] : SPEAKER_10
    Denise is in the Vic.

00:02:52.898 → 00:02:53.168 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_10
    Dad?

00:02:56.560 → 00:02:57.168 [00:00:00.607] : SPEAKER_10
    I don't get it.

00:02:57.995 → 00:03:00.037 [00:00:02.042] : SPEAKER_10
    What's the matter with you? Why do you want to do something?

00:03:01.910 → 00:03:03.901 [00:00:01.991] : SPEAKER_10
    Or if you won't, I will. I'm going over there.

00:03:03.901 → 00:03:04.407 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_06
    Here, no.

00:03:07.428 → 00:03:11.714 [00:00:04.286] : SPEAKER_06
    You can't just go around accusing someone of something like this, especially Denise.

00:03:11.377 → 00:03:15.730 [00:00:04.354] : SPEAKER_05
    Lauren wouldn't have just said all that because she felt like it. Okay, she must have had a reason.

00:03:15.562 → 00:03:15.578 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_06
    you

00:03:15.578 → 00:03:18.683 [00:00:03.105] : SPEAKER_10
    She said she found something. Something Summer Hayes had been working on.

00:03:18.683 → 00:03:19.004 [00:00:00.321] : SPEAKER_05
    more.

00:03:19.882 → 00:03:21.215 [00:00:01.333] : SPEAKER_10
    Well, I don't know. Not exactly.

00:03:22.227 → 00:03:23.122 [00:00:00.894] : SPEAKER_05
    Come and get her then.

00:03:24.320 → 00:03:25.012 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_10
    She's not here.

00:03:25.467 → 00:03:26.530 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_05
    Where is she?

00:03:28.268 → 00:03:29.450 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_10
    What were we talking about lowering for?

00:03:30.277 → 00:03:31.913 [00:00:01.637] : SPEAKER_10
    Dad Denise

00:03:48.451 → 00:03:48.822 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_01
    Woo!

00:03:50.324 → 00:03:51.758 [00:00:01.434] : SPEAKER_01
    I'm having to in and Jane.

00:03:53.024 → 00:03:54.273 [00:00:01.249] : SPEAKER_01
    Maybe there was a problem.

00:03:55.167 → 00:04:01.259 [00:00:06.092] : SPEAKER_01
    When you saw her face when the registrar said to say, I do, she didn't exactly blush, just like, yes, did she?

00:04:12.160 → 00:04:12.937 [00:00:00.776] : SPEAKER_12
    Very good.

00:04:12.937 → 00:04:12.953 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:04:12.953 → 00:04:12.970 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_12
    you

00:04:16.008 → 00:04:16.683 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_09
    I'm not ashamed.

00:04:18.016 → 00:04:18.472 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_01
    What?

00:04:18.472 → 00:04:18.505 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_00
    you

00:04:19.501 → 00:04:21.307 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_09
    I'm not saying anything your mum doesn't know.

00:04:23.146 → 00:04:24.749 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_00
    What do you think he's doing?

00:04:24.968 → 00:04:27.162 [00:00:02.194] : SPEAKER_09
    No, just don't. Keep your head in here.

00:04:27.702 → 00:04:29.052 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_09
    I'm gonna have a part of the square.

00:04:33.102 → 00:04:33.777 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_02
    She's not in.

00:04:34.132 → 00:04:35.262 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_11
    That's the place Cush is right.

00:04:36.140 → 00:04:37.034 [00:00:00.894] : SPEAKER_11
    What's going on here?

00:04:37.692 → 00:04:42.873 [00:00:05.181] : SPEAKER_11
    What do you think it's called? It's called a police. You don't think it's weird? It's not cotton. Of course it's weird. It's nothing to do with us.

00:04:43.632 → 00:04:46.265 [00:00:02.633] : SPEAKER_11
    And long we don't do anything about it, then all the police gonna wonder why.

00:04:49.218 → 00:04:49.724 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah.

00:04:51.867 → 00:04:52.863 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah, okay.

00:04:58.583 → 00:04:59.140 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_11
    What do you do?

00:05:13.062 → 00:05:13.737 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_08
    How did you...

00:05:13.400 → 00:05:16.893 [00:00:03.493] : SPEAKER_02
    We were just seeing where it was like for Cat and the Boys.

00:05:18.867 → 00:05:19.424 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_02
    Johnny.

00:05:21.517 → 00:05:21.871 [00:00:00.354] : SPEAKER_11
    No.

00:05:21.685 → 00:05:23.660 [00:00:01.974] : SPEAKER_02
    No one else has been here, is it? It's just us.

00:05:22.715 → 00:05:24.571 [00:00:01.856] : SPEAKER_11
    It was just us. It was all boarded up.

00:05:25.280 → 00:05:27.237 [00:00:01.957] : SPEAKER_02
    Charlie, what are you doing?

00:05:28.688 → 00:05:29.482 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_02
    Yes, Tacey.

00:05:32.468 → 00:05:33.076 [00:00:00.608] : SPEAKER_02
    You know.

00:05:35.843 → 00:05:36.890 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_02
    You knew he was here.

00:05:47.993 → 00:05:49.276 [00:00:01.282] : SPEAKER_10
    You can't just sit here.

00:05:50.761 → 00:05:52.499 [00:00:01.738] : SPEAKER_06
    So what Denise was like when it happened?

00:05:53.123 → 00:05:54.845 [00:00:01.721] : SPEAKER_06
    She was like the rest of us. She was in bits.

00:05:55.503 → 00:05:56.718 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_10
    But you see that all the time though.

00:05:57.528 → 00:05:59.452 [00:00:01.924] : SPEAKER_10
    People do something and then they pretend they haven't.

00:06:00.329 → 00:06:01.392 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_10
    people believe them too.

00:06:03.164 → 00:06:05.881 [00:00:02.717] : SPEAKER_06
    you're there to just march into the walk up to the nation.

00:06:05.155 → 00:06:08.632 [00:00:03.476] : SPEAKER_07
    Yes, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. But just me.

00:06:09.610 → 00:06:10.252 [00:00:00.641] : SPEAKER_07
    Not you, okay?

00:06:10.792 → 00:06:11.129 [00:00:00.338] : SPEAKER_06
    in.

00:06:12.209 → 00:06:12.968 [00:00:00.759] : SPEAKER_06
    Think about this.

00:06:13.694 → 00:06:14.690 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_07
    I don't need to think about it.

00:06:15.820 → 00:06:17.002 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_07
    I'll know in a minute, I ask her.

00:06:18.098 → 00:06:19.010 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_07
    I'll see it in her eyes.

00:06:37.201 → 00:06:38.804 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_04
    Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

    you

00:06:51.106 → 00:06:53.840 [00:00:02.734] : SPEAKER_12
    So what do we do now? Well, you heard Ab. She's...

00:06:55.865 → 00:06:58.312 [00:00:02.447] : SPEAKER_12
    My little girl, what's happened to her?

00:06:59.628 → 00:07:01.045 [00:00:01.418] : SPEAKER_09
    what you're trying to say and what it's all my fault.

00:07:01.957 → 00:07:04.302 [00:00:02.346] : SPEAKER_12
    I didn't say that. I didn't mean that either.

00:07:08.335 → 00:07:09.753 [00:00:01.417] : SPEAKER_12
    Remember when she wanted to be over there.

00:07:32.838 → 00:07:33.260 [00:00:00.422] : SPEAKER_07
    I'm in.

00:07:33.935 → 00:07:35.217 [00:00:01.283] : SPEAKER_07
    Not now, Mike.

00:07:35.808 → 00:07:37.782 [00:00:01.974] : SPEAKER_07
    Tell Mick I'll be in a bit. We've got a problem.

00:07:41.191 → 00:07:41.765 [00:00:00.574] : SPEAKER_07
    We grew up here.

00:07:42.929 → 00:07:43.216 [00:00:00.287] : SPEAKER_07
    What?

00:07:44.178 → 00:07:44.583 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_07
    You're me.

00:07:46.591 → 00:07:47.435 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_07
    No more place.

00:07:48.869 → 00:07:49.730 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_07
    Don't move families.

00:07:52.649 → 00:07:53.375 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_07
    Memoanda it.

    And I walk.

00:08:03.280 → 00:08:06.183 [00:00:02.902] : SPEAKER_11
    Five minutes. There's nothing to do with a wedding. It's done.

00:08:08.191 → 00:08:08.562 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_11
    Stop.

00:08:12.663 → 00:08:13.237 [00:00:00.574] : SPEAKER_10
    or silent.

00:08:19.396 → 00:08:19.615 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_08
    Huh?

00:08:21.387 → 00:08:22.433 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_08
    I'm gonna make it for.

00:08:22.990 → 00:08:24.155 [00:00:01.164] : SPEAKER_00
    So you can start talking.

00:08:25.471 → 00:08:26.973 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_00
    But for starters, where have you been? What have you been doing?

00:08:32.710 → 00:08:33.554 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_00
    That's a lot of money.

00:08:34.516 → 00:08:37.098 [00:00:02.582] : SPEAKER_08
    I should have been double that. I had expenses but sir.

00:08:37.638 → 00:08:39.089 [00:00:01.451] : SPEAKER_08
    I'm not going to spend any more where I come from.

00:08:39.292 → 00:08:40.152 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_00
    Plenty more of what?

00:08:40.928 → 00:08:41.755 [00:00:00.827] : SPEAKER_00
    Living like this.

00:08:42.852 → 00:08:46.058 [00:00:03.206] : SPEAKER_00
    My gut's twisting into a knot every time they'll build. Pull up on the square.

00:08:46.058 → 00:08:49.214 [00:00:03.156] : SPEAKER_08
    Oh, he didn't marry a quiet boy, Sharon, as long as that's really a shock, is it?

00:08:49.214 → 00:08:50.699 [00:00:01.485] : SPEAKER_00
    I didn't want to marry a choir boy.

00:08:50.699 → 00:08:52.994 [00:00:02.295] : SPEAKER_08
    as well because you've not exactly been an angel. I wanted to

00:08:52.403 → 00:08:54.530 [00:00:02.126] : SPEAKER_00
    I wanted to marry a man I could count on.

00:08:55.036 → 00:08:56.251 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_00
    Who'd be there for us?

00:08:58.006 → 00:09:00.217 [00:00:02.211] : SPEAKER_00
    I hate it for living like this.

00:09:01.634 → 00:09:03.575 [00:00:01.941] : SPEAKER_00
    seeing you in prison all beaten up.

00:09:04.520 → 00:09:04.975 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_08
    knowing.

00:09:05.735 → 00:09:07.017 [00:00:01.283] : SPEAKER_00
    So this time what about the next?

00:09:08.165 → 00:09:12.940 [00:00:04.776] : SPEAKER_08
    You stick to your business, okay? And I'll stick the sword out, Max and the mess you made of mine.

00:09:13.835 → 00:09:16.855 [00:00:03.021] : SPEAKER_08
    What do you want me to do, Sharon? We named that my allotment, I got gardening.

00:09:16.703 → 00:09:18.577 [00:00:01.873] : SPEAKER_00
    I want you to run your businesses.

00:09:19.150 → 00:09:23.167 [00:00:04.016] : SPEAKER_00
    Do your deals. Just keep right away from the sort of stuff that's gonna put you back in the neck.

00:09:23.268 → 00:09:24.027 [00:00:00.759] : SPEAKER_08
    I've got nothing about it.

00:09:24.027 → 00:09:24.584 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_00
    No Phil.

00:09:25.394 → 00:09:26.035 [00:00:00.641] : SPEAKER_08
    You do it.

00:09:27.976 → 00:09:28.381 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_08
    Oh

00:09:29.157 → 00:09:29.613 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_00
    I told you.

00:09:30.473 → 00:09:31.520 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_00
    I can't live like this.

00:09:32.397 → 00:09:34.490 [00:00:02.092] : SPEAKER_00
    No, I won't live like this.

00:09:35.384 → 00:09:37.223 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_00
    And if you tell me I have to, then I will walk.

00:09:37.949 → 00:09:40.632 [00:00:02.683] : SPEAKER_00
    Away from you, from the Albert, everything. We're through.

00:09:42.674 → 00:09:44.108 [00:00:01.434] : SPEAKER_08

00:09:44.800 → 00:09:45.307 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_08
    It could be.

00:09:46.923 → 00:09:47.598 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_05
    That's up to you.

00:09:47.028 → 00:09:47.703 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_08

    you

00:10:03.899 → 00:10:05.637 [00:00:01.738] : SPEAKER_05
    I don't seem that surprised by all this.

00:10:04.004 → 00:10:05.759 [00:00:01.755] : SPEAKER_11
    I don't think that's surprised by all this.

00:10:09.738 → 00:10:11.105 [00:00:01.367] : SPEAKER_05
    And the way that was talking.

00:10:09.860 → 00:10:11.210 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_11

00:10:56.532 → 00:10:57.713 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_08
    We should set her back for the wedding.

00:10:59.772 → 00:11:01.865 [00:00:02.093] : SPEAKER_08
    They're in the cafe now, just the two of them.

00:12:33.918 → 00:12:35.133 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_00
    Why should she send that card to you?

00:12:36.213 → 00:12:37.732 [00:00:01.519] : SPEAKER_00
    Going one up to me or to Ian?

00:12:38.187 → 00:12:38.710 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_04

00:12:41.275 → 00:12:42.085 [00:00:00.810] : SPEAKER_00
    Is that what Emma thought?

00:12:42.457 → 00:12:42.862 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_07
    Listen.

00:12:43.908 → 00:12:46.928 [00:00:03.021] : SPEAKER_07
    No one actually knows what Lauren was saying or what Emma felt.

00:12:46.878 → 00:12:48.785 [00:00:01.907] : SPEAKER_00
    Who will I send it in the first place then?

00:12:49.527 → 00:12:52.700 [00:00:03.173] : SPEAKER_00
    What's the point if she didn't actually know anything?

00:12:55.703 → 00:12:56.227 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_00
    This.

00:12:56.767 → 00:13:05.609 [00:00:08.842] : SPEAKER_00
    is just a few stupid words on a piece of paper. Cindy. And now we're all here looking at each other wondering if... Cindy.

00:13:07.246 → 00:13:08.933 [00:00:01.688] : SPEAKER_07
    No one is looking at anyone.

00:13:09.440 → 00:13:11.279 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_07
    and no one is wondering anything either.

00:13:12.680 → 00:13:14.013 [00:00:01.333] : SPEAKER_07
    if it happens here.

00:13:15.565 → 00:13:16.443 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_07
    Someone could have got in.

00:13:17.455 → 00:13:20.223 [00:00:02.768] : SPEAKER_07
    or Lucy could have met someone and they could have followed her home.

00:13:21.370 → 00:13:22.754 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_07
    Peter gets a drink of water, will you?

00:14:01.432 → 00:14:09.734 [00:00:08.303] : SPEAKER_11
    Maybe you were right, you know. You know what you said at the wedding? Maybe she has come to her senses. I didn't mean it though. Ain't that much of a half-faced cat.

00:14:11.810 → 00:14:16.012 [00:00:04.202] : SPEAKER_11
    What meaning that I am but I did I did say that which sounded a bit like it

00:14:16.957 → 00:14:25.006 [00:00:08.049] : SPEAKER_11
    Well, you do seem a bit bitter and twisted. Oh, nice. So now I'm a bitter and twisted-eyed face, Count. Oi, oi. This is a wedding. Remember, you're lucky you're still welcoming us.

00:14:25.529 → 00:14:30.052 [00:00:04.522] : SPEAKER_11
    We're all happy, smiley people. Anyway, I'll probably last longer than yours.

00:14:31.385 → 00:14:54.807 [00:00:23.422] : SPEAKER_11
    You know what I'm not gonna go back that, so keep your big nose out, Ken. I've had enough of this. Whatever mistake I made, at least I realised before it was too late. What mistake? I ain't made no mistake. Oh, no, no. Of course not. You just let some loser knock you up and then run out and you're... It was for my bubbles. Oh, yeah. So just remember that when you're coming over all holier than that, because whatever mistakes I made, they ain't gonna spend a lifetime paying for them.

00:14:47.888 → 00:14:48.563 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_10
    So just

00:15:09.961 → 00:15:16.340 [00:00:06.379] : SPEAKER_09
    We don't know aggro from you either. Me? I'm all sweetness and light, me.

00:15:26.667 → 00:15:27.511 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_04
    It's about time.

00:15:29.063 → 00:15:29.941 [00:00:00.877] : SPEAKER_04
    Ian and Charnel on the way back.

00:15:31.949 → 00:15:34.042 [00:00:02.092] : SPEAKER_04
    Come on, Peter, everyone's waiting. Don't see righty in there.

00:15:35.240 → 00:15:36.320 [00:00:01.080] : SPEAKER_04
    No, I'm just kidding.

00:15:40.268 → 00:15:42.074 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_04
    If you know what? Why do you ask that?

00:15:44.150 → 00:15:46.985 [00:00:02.835] : SPEAKER_04
    You seem a bit weird or something. You seem a bit weird yourself.

00:15:46.698 → 00:15:47.002 [00:00:00.304] : SPEAKER_11
    boy.

    There you go.

00:15:51.203 → 00:15:51.220 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_07
    you

00:15:52.942 → 00:15:54.292 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_11
    She deserved it, OK?

00:15:56.367 → 00:15:57.903 [00:00:01.536] : SPEAKER_11
    You have what she said to me.

00:15:59.692 → 00:16:01.244 [00:00:01.553] : SPEAKER_11
    It's got to be like the Black Bull Tunneler.

00:16:06.425 → 00:16:08.230 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_11
    Yes, I'll try.

00:16:16.938 → 00:16:18.372 [00:00:01.434] : SPEAKER_04
    Ah, here he is.

00:16:19.857 → 00:16:21.494 [00:00:01.637] : SPEAKER_04
    I'm gonna take a picture of you.

00:16:22.675 → 00:16:22.692 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_04
    you

00:16:22.692 → 00:16:23.688 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_02
    Nothing wrong is it?

00:16:23.688 → 00:16:23.722 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_04
    you

00:16:25.544 → 00:16:25.679 [00:00:00.135] : SPEAKER_06
    you

00:16:25.679 → 00:16:25.696 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_02
    you

00:16:25.696 → 00:16:25.713 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_06

00:16:25.730 → 00:16:26.270 [00:00:00.540] : SPEAKER_06
    needed

00:16:26.270 → 00:16:27.232 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_02
    Don't you?

00:16:30.134 → 00:16:30.944 [00:00:00.810] : SPEAKER_05
    So, uh...

00:16:32.159 → 00:16:33.256 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_05
    Where is the biting grip?

00:16:34.589 → 00:16:35.669 [00:00:01.080] : SPEAKER_02
    Yeah.

00:16:36.378 → 00:16:37.981 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_05
    I'll get the music cranked up a bit.

00:16:38.842 → 00:16:39.517 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_05
    Yeah, I'm gonna

00:16:42.031 → 00:16:44.073 [00:00:02.042] : SPEAKER_04
    Yeah, yeah, I'll go get him.

00:16:44.562 → 00:16:45.693 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_08
    Why do you know when you drink?

00:16:49.051 → 00:16:49.439 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_08
    Okay?

00:16:49.439 → 00:16:49.490 [00:00:00.051] : SPEAKER_11
    you

00:16:52.730 → 00:16:53.168 [00:00:00.439] : SPEAKER_11
    Okay?

00:16:58.822 → 00:17:01.387 [00:00:02.565] : SPEAKER_11
    Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

00:17:04.306 → 00:17:04.677 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_11
    Kim.

00:17:07.799 → 00:17:08.170 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_11
    Kim!

00:17:09.385 → 00:17:10.128 [00:00:00.743] : SPEAKER_11
    I can't hear you.

00:17:10.972 → 00:17:11.883 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_11
    at least I tried

00:17:16.237 → 00:17:16.726 [00:00:00.489] : SPEAKER_11
    Oh

00:17:16.726 → 00:17:16.810 [00:00:00.084] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:17:18.363 → 00:17:18.380 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_11
    you

00:17:18.380 → 00:17:19.156 [00:00:00.776] : SPEAKER_10
    Oh

00:17:19.966 → 00:17:20.033 [00:00:00.068] : SPEAKER_10
    Bye.

00:17:21.535 → 00:17:23.105 [00:00:01.569] : SPEAKER_10
    If Abby wants to come and stay, then...

00:17:22.987 → 00:17:23.577 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_06
    I'm sorry.

00:17:23.577 → 00:17:27.863 [00:00:04.286] : SPEAKER_10
    Right, I'm just saying, if Ibra and the girls do, then they know they can.

00:17:28.572 → 00:17:29.180 [00:00:00.608] : SPEAKER_10
    Where is Lauren?

00:17:31.593 → 00:17:35.204 [00:00:03.611] : SPEAKER_10
    Come on, Max. You saw Abby. She's a mess. I'm talking about she ain't a mess.

00:17:36.841 → 00:17:39.288 [00:00:02.447] : SPEAKER_06
    All right, we've seen as a mess we made already one. We did.

00:17:39.288 → 00:17:39.322 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:17:39.322 → 00:17:39.608 [00:00:00.287] : SPEAKER_06
    Wait.

00:17:40.132 → 00:17:40.857 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_06
    Yeah, you and me.

00:17:41.583 → 00:17:41.971 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_10
    Bye.

00:17:42.967 → 00:17:48.755 [00:00:05.788] : SPEAKER_10
    So I'm the one who had an affair with Stacey, am I? No, it wasn't just about that. It was Lucy as well. Seriously.

00:17:47.675 → 00:17:48.417 [00:00:00.743] : SPEAKER_06
    We want.

00:17:48.417 → 00:17:48.822 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_09
    the

00:17:48.822 → 00:17:49.092 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_10
    not.

00:17:49.058 → 00:17:49.075 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_09
    you

00:17:49.075 → 00:17:49.953 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_06
    Can't mess it up.

00:17:49.092 → 00:17:51.910 [00:00:02.818] : SPEAKER_09
    Turn this enough. Your daughter's best friend. Who's it going to be next time?

00:17:51.185 → 00:17:51.202 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:17:51.202 → 00:17:52.585 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_06
    What happened the next time, is it?

00:17:52.568 → 00:17:58.778 [00:00:06.210] : SPEAKER_09
    Abby was a sweet innocent little daddy's girl and she still would be now if it weren't for you and everything that you have done so don't you dare lay any of that at my door.

00:17:58.272 → 00:18:01.765 [00:00:03.493] : SPEAKER_06
    Right, do you think any of this is out? Do you ask knocking seven bells out of each other's time?

00:18:06.794 → 00:18:08.110 [00:00:01.316] : SPEAKER_10
    I didn't come here to argue.

00:18:10.304 → 00:18:11.131 [00:00:00.827] : SPEAKER_06
    So why did you come?

00:18:14.793 → 00:18:15.755 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_10
    For my best nights, I do.

00:18:16.312 → 00:18:16.852 [00:00:00.540] : SPEAKER_06
    Oh yeah.

00:18:17.476 → 00:18:17.695 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_10
    Thank you.

00:18:32.343 → 00:18:33.473 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_03
    That's right what they say then.

00:18:35.549 → 00:18:36.427 [00:00:00.877] : SPEAKER_03
    That pen is...

00:18:37.658 → 00:18:38.519 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_03
    Always turn up.

00:18:41.658 → 00:18:42.839 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_03
    I don't know why, mind you.

00:18:44.341 → 00:18:46.619 [00:00:02.278] : SPEAKER_03
    I mean, Max, he's already got one of your businesses.

00:18:47.767 → 00:18:49.623 [00:00:01.856] : SPEAKER_03
    It's only a matter of time before he gets the rest.

00:18:52.441 → 00:18:53.133 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_03
    R and R.

00:18:54.263 → 00:18:54.922 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_03
    the album.

00:18:56.474 → 00:18:58.027 [00:00:01.553] : SPEAKER_03
    maybe even the landlady.

00:18:59.225 → 00:18:59.528 [00:00:00.304] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh

00:19:00.490 → 00:19:01.368 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_03
    I struck a nerve.

00:19:03.713 → 00:19:04.844 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_03
    Not that he'd want to mind.

00:19:05.941 → 00:19:06.903 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_03
    just because he could.

00:19:07.983 → 00:19:08.708 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_03
    Bring any bells?

00:19:10.582 → 00:19:12.843 [00:00:02.261] : SPEAKER_03
    Also Max, I don't seem much

00:19:13.619 → 00:19:14.345 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_03
    Well, she proper...

00:19:15.678 → 00:19:16.775 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_03
    You lost the words to fight.

00:19:17.956 → 00:19:20.740 [00:00:02.784] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah, or something's ain't worth fighting for, are they? What do you mean, me?

00:19:22.563 → 00:19:23.069 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh, sure.

00:19:25.364 → 00:19:26.562 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_03
    It's just weird. That's a weird thing.

00:19:28.385 → 00:19:29.296 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_03
    seeing you out here.

00:19:30.764 → 00:19:32.030 [00:00:01.266] : SPEAKER_03
    Shouldn't you be with your wife?

00:19:52.077 → 00:19:52.162 [00:00:00.084] : SPEAKER_11
    you

00:19:52.137 → 00:19:52.559 [00:00:00.422] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah.

00:19:52.162 → 00:19:52.432 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_10
    and the

00:19:52.432 → 00:19:52.499 [00:00:00.067] : SPEAKER_11
    the

00:19:53.900 → 00:19:56.086 [00:00:02.186] : SPEAKER_02
    Drink this. I don't want nothing to drink.

00:19:57.747 → 00:19:58.439 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_11
    Victor.

00:19:57.841 → 00:19:58.499 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_03
    Dot.

00:19:59.873 → 00:20:01.814 [00:00:01.941] : SPEAKER_11
    We've got to do something about this.

00:19:59.950 → 00:20:01.874 [00:00:01.924] : SPEAKER_03
    We've got to do something about this.

00:20:03.704 → 00:20:04.726 [00:00:01.022] : SPEAKER_02
    Tell us what happened.

00:20:07.282 → 00:20:08.337 [00:00:01.056] : SPEAKER_02
    I let him do it.

00:20:10.623 → 00:20:10.758 [00:00:00.135] : SPEAKER_09
    with

00:20:10.683 → 00:20:10.818 [00:00:00.135] : SPEAKER_02
    with

00:20:10.910 → 00:20:11.517 [00:00:00.607] : SPEAKER_09
    Do what?

00:20:10.970 → 00:20:11.560 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_03
    Do what?

00:20:12.800 → 00:20:14.260 [00:00:01.461] : SPEAKER_02
    I'll let him take his drug.

00:20:16.049 → 00:20:17.602 [00:00:01.552] : SPEAKER_02
    and then I let him die.

00:20:18.968 → 00:20:21.432 [00:00:02.464] : SPEAKER_02
    I can see from your eyes you're thinking

00:20:22.259 → 00:20:26.039 [00:00:03.780] : SPEAKER_02
    What sort of mother does that make me? Don't you sight out.

00:20:26.039 → 00:20:32.047 [00:00:06.007] : SPEAKER_00
    Don't you ever say that. You were the best mum Nick could have ever had. It's not me saying that.

00:20:32.620 → 00:20:35.624 [00:00:03.004] : SPEAKER_00
    That's what my auntie Pauline used to say, time after time and me grand.

00:20:37.227 → 00:20:39.218 [00:00:01.991] : SPEAKER_03
    Mum and parents never knew that you did it either.

00:20:40.366 → 00:20:42.070 [00:00:01.704] : SPEAKER_03
    You know, you kept stepping in and...

00:20:43.032 → 00:20:44.534 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_03
    and taken his side, but...

00:20:45.023 → 00:20:48.668 [00:00:03.645] : SPEAKER_02
    But what? You can only take so much and then you snap?

00:20:49.293 → 00:20:54.997 [00:00:05.704] : SPEAKER_02
    Yes, that's the truth. I snapped. And I didn't do it out of love.

00:20:55.520 → 00:20:59.080 [00:00:03.561] : SPEAKER_02
    Not like we there thought. I did it out of anger.

00:21:00.515 → 00:21:09.644 [00:00:09.129] : SPEAKER_02
    for all the suffering it caused. I wanted him to face judgement, I didn't want him to be released. I wanted to punish him, and I did.

00:21:11.197 → 00:21:11.416 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_02
    and

00:21:12.563 → 00:21:13.762 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_00
    You've kept all this to yourself.

00:21:14.858 → 00:21:18.959 [00:00:04.101] : SPEAKER_02
    I just kept pretending it hadn't happened, you know, carrying on as normal.

00:21:19.820 → 00:21:29.000 [00:00:09.180] : SPEAKER_02
    You know, they say that you should be wary of strangers, but it's the ones you love who hurt you the most, and you hurt the ones that love you the most too.

00:21:30.535 → 00:21:31.767 [00:00:01.232] : SPEAKER_02
    Nick was my test.

00:21:32.797 → 00:21:33.910 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_02
    and I failed it.

00:21:34.619 → 00:21:38.197 [00:00:03.577] : SPEAKER_02
    I failed him in his life, and I failed him in his death.

00:24:58.553 → 00:25:04.966 [00:00:06.412] : SPEAKER_03
    She knows there's no reason for anyone else to find out though, is there? We can't actually pretend it ain't happened. Come on in, it's not her fault, not really.

00:25:04.966 → 00:25:06.805 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_04

    No.

00:25:10.518 → 00:25:12.239 [00:00:01.721] : SPEAKER_04

00:25:12.897 → 00:25:14.281 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_04

00:25:15.125 → 00:25:16.627 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_04

00:25:26.667 → 00:25:27.815 [00:00:01.147] : SPEAKER_03
    If we all agree it hasn't happened.

00:25:28.270 → 00:25:30.920 [00:00:02.649] : SPEAKER_04
    Well that ain't gonna stop Dot saying it, has it? She can say what she wants.

00:25:31.544 → 00:25:33.772 [00:00:02.227] : SPEAKER_04

00:25:36.877 → 00:25:37.838 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_04
    She's an old lady, I suppose.

    Yeah, they'll just say that she's wondering in the hate or something.

00:29:57.436 → 00:30:06.683 [00:00:09.247] : SPEAKER_00
    Are you all right? This isn't pretending, this is covering up! What's the difference? Oh, about five years. What did he say? If anyone had found out about the first, we'd have probably got a slap on the wrist. Diz!

00:29:57.494 → 00:30:06.758 [00:00:09.264] : SPEAKER_01
    Are you all right? This isn't pretending, this is covering up! What's the difference? Oh, about five years. What did he say? If anyone had found out about the first, we'd have probably got a slap on the wrist. Diz!

    Just relax.

00:50:55.452 → 00:50:55.537 [00:00:00.084] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:50:55.537 → 00:50:56.212 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_01
    See you.

00:50:57.730 → 00:51:00.616 [00:00:02.886] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh no, no, no, no, don't do this.

00:51:03.164 → 00:51:04.649 [00:00:01.485] : SPEAKER_01
    Dad! Dad!

00:51:14.926 → 00:51:15.415 [00:00:00.489] : SPEAKER_01
    We do it.

00:51:16.732 → 00:51:22.469 [00:00:05.738] : SPEAKER_01
    Stay back. Dain, you know there's a pub full of people through there. You know, you've got an alarm, haven't you? Don't you? Don't you? I've worn it.

00:51:23.009 → 00:51:29.270 [00:00:06.261] : SPEAKER_01
    It's your pub, I won't let your punters. I'm not a madman and I'm not your slapper of a wife called me either. That'd be stupid.

00:51:28.156 → 00:51:28.527 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_00
    That'd be sh-

00:51:31.666 → 00:51:32.054 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_01
    that you

00:51:33.657 → 00:51:34.838 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_01
    You can go if you want, then.

00:51:37.555 → 00:51:37.825 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_01
    No.

00:51:38.332 → 00:51:39.462 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_01
    They make your dad sell this out.

00:51:40.002 → 00:51:40.897 [00:00:00.894] : SPEAKER_01
    Got no argument with you.

00:51:41.268 → 00:51:41.977 [00:00:00.709] : SPEAKER_00
    Then she's right.

00:51:43.647 → 00:51:44.693 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_00
    You ain't got a clue what you're doing.

00:51:45.301 → 00:51:49.250 [00:00:03.949] : SPEAKER_01
    And Nancy was right from the off. You see, Nancy knew there was something going on between me and Linda.

00:51:52.000 → 00:51:53.030 [00:00:01.029] : SPEAKER_01
    You know, out of life.

00:51:53.671 → 00:51:54.262 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_01
    Before her.

00:51:57.012 → 00:51:57.923 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_01
    I had a family.

00:51:59.476 → 00:51:59.948 [00:00:00.472] : SPEAKER_01
    Home.

00:52:01.585 → 00:52:03.982 [00:00:02.396] : SPEAKER_01
    And she took it all away from me. She took it all.

00:52:05.382 → 00:52:06.530 [00:00:01.148] : SPEAKER_01
    I'm not a rapist, though.

00:52:07.357 → 00:52:08.234 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_01
    Just an arsonist.

00:52:09.162 → 00:52:11.474 [00:00:02.312] : SPEAKER_01
    or anything I'm doing, you've made me do.

00:52:12.554 → 00:52:14.343 [00:00:01.789] : SPEAKER_00
    Just like Linda, when she lets you on.

00:52:15.440 → 00:52:16.655 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_00
    Wasn't your fault, Naver, was it?

00:52:16.807 → 00:52:16.992 [00:00:00.186] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:52:18.089 → 00:52:18.562 [00:00:00.473] : SPEAKER_01
    You're welcome.

00:52:18.865 → 00:52:19.793 [00:00:00.928] : SPEAKER_00
    Nothing ever is.

00:52:24.603 → 00:52:25.396 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_01
    You scared me.

00:52:25.598 → 00:52:25.615 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_00
    you

00:52:25.615 → 00:52:25.919 [00:00:00.304] : SPEAKER_01
    not.

00:52:27.742 → 00:52:30.037 [00:00:02.295] : SPEAKER_01
    You're the one who's scared. No, I'm not scared of anyone.

00:52:31.505 → 00:52:36.348 [00:00:04.843] : SPEAKER_01
    Hey, you just remember I did you a favor by sleeping with her. I opened your eyes.

00:52:37.360 → 00:52:38.980 [00:00:01.620] : SPEAKER_01
    You know your mum's through there, don't you?

00:52:44.515 → 00:52:45.764 [00:00:01.249] : SPEAKER_00
    You shut your mouth.

00:52:48.127 → 00:52:48.886 [00:00:00.759] : SPEAKER_00
    That's what you do it.

00:52:49.831 → 00:52:51.097 [00:00:01.266] : SPEAKER_00
    Daddy's not breathing!

00:52:56.800 → 00:52:57.593 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_00
    Dad!

00:53:50.142 → 00:53:50.665 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_03
    It's me.

00:53:53.450 → 00:53:53.888 [00:00:00.439] : SPEAKER_03
    I know.

00:53:56.302 → 00:53:56.943 [00:00:00.641] : SPEAKER_03
    I know.

00:54:00.250 → 00:54:01.094 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_03
    You killed Lucy.

00:54:03.136 → 00:54:04.300 [00:00:01.164] : SPEAKER_03
    Get everyone out the house.

00:54:06.832 → 00:54:07.557 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_03
    I'm coming home.

00:54:20.467 → 00:54:20.500 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:54:20.500 → 00:54:20.669 [00:00:00.169] : SPEAKER_02
    Hey!

00:54:20.669 → 00:54:20.686 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_01
    Bye.

00:54:23.116 → 00:54:23.521 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_01
    Charlie!

00:54:25.073 → 00:54:25.630 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_01
    What's happened?

00:54:31.351 → 00:54:32.228 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_03
    Goodbye.

00:54:33.916 → 00:54:34.372 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_03
    No.

    Tell me exactly.

00:55:35.712 → 00:55:36.809 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_02
    What happened that night?

00:56:31.265 → 00:56:31.282 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:56:31.282 → 00:56:31.518 [00:00:00.236] : SPEAKER_00
    awesome

00:56:31.518 → 00:56:33.205 [00:00:01.688] : SPEAKER_03
    The pool dark is alive.

00:56:34.572 → 00:56:36.462 [00:00:01.890] : SPEAKER_03
    Who doesn't break a man, makes a man?

00:56:37.559 → 00:56:37.627 [00:00:00.068] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:56:37.627 → 00:56:49.186 [00:00:11.559] : SPEAKER_01
    My body is to be married. Who's it to be Elizabeth?

00:56:52.493 → 00:56:57.708 [00:00:05.214] : SPEAKER_01
    What's your name? Demel the card. Rustpal doc.

00:56:58.805 → 00:57:00.003 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_01
    People save us.

00:57:00.796 → 00:57:03.344 [00:00:02.548] : SPEAKER_01
    Your place is here. Your land, your mind.

00:57:03.428 → 00:57:03.445 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:57:03.445 → 00:57:03.968 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_01
    Where did you see that?

00:57:03.968 → 00:57:08.272 [00:00:04.303] : SPEAKER_03
    I think I was going.
