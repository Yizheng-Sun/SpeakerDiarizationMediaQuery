00:00:00.217 → 00:00:02.275 [00:00:02.059] : SPEAKER_03
    Biscuits there, Martin. Here we go.

00:00:00.250 → 00:00:00.807 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_00
    Biscuits that

00:00:02.275 → 00:00:02.292 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_07
    you

00:00:40.210 → 00:00:41.813 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_06
    It really stinks in here, doesn't it?

00:00:42.252 → 00:00:47.450 [00:00:05.197] : SPEAKER_11
    I'm still not sure about this, guys. He's a bit late for that now, isn't he? This place is actually safe.

00:00:48.766 → 00:00:49.762 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_06
    What's on your fire?

00:00:50.842 → 00:00:52.192 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_06
    I can do nothing.

00:00:55.162 → 00:00:57.524 [00:00:02.363] : SPEAKER_06
    Just needs a bit of fresh liquor paint.

00:00:58.469 → 00:00:59.077 [00:00:00.607] : SPEAKER_06
    They're fine.

00:01:26.043 → 00:01:26.887 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_06
    It's not neat.

00:01:27.967 → 00:01:29.080 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_11
    Who's Nick? Don't son.

00:01:30.076 → 00:01:30.532 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_11
    Right there.

00:01:31.308 → 00:01:33.299 [00:00:01.991] : SPEAKER_11
    You can see the way that it's going.

00:01:34.160 → 00:01:35.965 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_11
    You ain't doing too much now, mate.

00:01:36.961 → 00:01:39.239 [00:00:02.278] : SPEAKER_06
    I thought we died ages ago.

00:01:39.948 → 00:01:40.927 [00:00:00.979] : SPEAKER_11
    Don't look like him.

00:01:42.648 → 00:01:43.576 [00:00:00.928] : SPEAKER_11
    They're called a police.

00:01:44.470 → 00:01:45.888 [00:00:01.417] : SPEAKER_06
    I need this next door.

00:01:45.905 → 00:01:47.187 [00:00:01.282] : SPEAKER_11
    Then sort this mess out.

00:01:47.373 → 00:01:50.242 [00:00:02.869] : SPEAKER_06
    No, why would he be squatting if he's mum's only?

00:01:53.988 → 00:01:54.376 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_06
    No.

00:01:55.017 → 00:01:57.970 [00:00:02.953] : SPEAKER_06
    Stays, we did. No, this ain't right. Well, we can see that, Stays.

00:01:57.970 → 00:01:58.460 [00:00:00.489] : SPEAKER_11
    Come on.

00:01:58.460 → 00:02:00.434 [00:00:01.974] : SPEAKER_06
    Just don't do anything. I need to speak to Dott.

00:02:13.883 → 00:02:17.697 [00:00:03.814] : SPEAKER_05
    Okay, I think we all need to calm down. One of us?

00:02:17.832 → 00:02:23.182 [00:00:05.349] : SPEAKER_09
    It has to be. What are you talking about? It was here. Everything happened here. Peter, for goodness sake.

00:02:24.380 → 00:02:25.038 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_09
    She told you.

00:02:25.915 → 00:02:27.637 [00:00:01.721] : SPEAKER_09
    What? Lauren said she told you.

00:02:28.210 → 00:02:36.293 [00:00:08.083] : SPEAKER_09
    Oh, she didn't tell me. Not exactly. She gave me a card. What card? What did he say? It said that Lucy was killed in this house. I saw it must have been someone who was here.

00:02:37.272 → 00:02:38.048 [00:00:00.776] : SPEAKER_05
    Well, think about it.

00:02:39.415 → 00:02:41.187 [00:00:01.772] : SPEAKER_05
    I was only here in Cindy living here at the time.

00:02:43.870 → 00:02:44.714 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_03
    And niece.

00:02:45.676 → 00:02:46.992 [00:00:01.316] : SPEAKER_03
    She was living here then too.

00:02:48.443 → 00:02:49.507 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_03
    Look, I want to see this card.

00:02:49.540 → 00:02:50.333 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_09
    Never mind that.

00:02:51.076 → 00:02:51.953 [00:00:00.877] : SPEAKER_09
    Denise is in the Vic.

00:02:52.898 → 00:02:53.168 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_09
    Dad?

00:02:56.560 → 00:02:57.168 [00:00:00.607] : SPEAKER_09
    I don't get it.

00:02:57.995 → 00:03:00.037 [00:00:02.042] : SPEAKER_09
    What's the matter with you? Why do you want to do something?

00:03:01.910 → 00:03:03.901 [00:00:01.991] : SPEAKER_09
    Or if you won't, I will. I'm going over there.

00:03:03.901 → 00:03:04.407 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_05
    Here, no.

00:03:07.428 → 00:03:11.714 [00:00:04.286] : SPEAKER_05
    You can't just go around accusing someone of something like this, especially Denise.

00:03:11.377 → 00:03:15.730 [00:00:04.354] : SPEAKER_03
    Lauren wouldn't have just said all that because she felt like it. Okay, she must have had a reason.

00:03:15.562 → 00:03:15.578 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_05
    you

00:03:15.578 → 00:03:18.700 [00:00:03.122] : SPEAKER_09
    She said she found something. Something Summer Hayes had been working on.

00:03:18.700 → 00:03:19.004 [00:00:00.304] : SPEAKER_03
    more.

00:03:19.882 → 00:03:21.215 [00:00:01.333] : SPEAKER_09
    Well, I don't know. Not exactly.

00:03:22.227 → 00:03:23.122 [00:00:00.894] : SPEAKER_03
    Come and get her then.

00:03:24.320 → 00:03:25.012 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_09
    She's not here.

00:03:25.467 → 00:03:26.530 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_03
    Where is she?

00:03:28.268 → 00:03:29.450 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_09
    What were we talking about lowering for?

00:03:30.277 → 00:03:31.913 [00:00:01.637] : SPEAKER_09
    Dad Denise

00:03:48.451 → 00:03:48.822 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_01
    Woo!

00:03:50.324 → 00:03:51.758 [00:00:01.434] : SPEAKER_01
    I'm having to in and Jane.

00:03:53.024 → 00:03:54.273 [00:00:01.249] : SPEAKER_01
    Maybe there was a problem.

00:03:55.167 → 00:04:01.259 [00:00:06.092] : SPEAKER_01
    When you saw her face when the registrar said to say, I do, she didn't exactly blush, just like, yes, did she?

00:04:12.160 → 00:04:12.970 [00:00:00.810] : SPEAKER_04
    Very good.

00:04:16.008 → 00:04:16.683 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_02
    I'm not ashamed.

00:04:18.016 → 00:04:18.033 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_04
    you

00:04:18.033 → 00:04:18.505 [00:00:00.472] : SPEAKER_00
    What?

00:04:19.501 → 00:04:21.307 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_02
    I'm not saying anything your mum doesn't know.

00:04:23.146 → 00:04:24.749 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_00
    What do you think he's doing?

00:04:24.968 → 00:04:27.162 [00:00:02.194] : SPEAKER_02
    No, just don't. Keep your head in here.

00:04:27.702 → 00:04:29.052 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_02
    I'm gonna have a part of the square.

00:04:33.102 → 00:04:33.777 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_06
    She's not in.

00:04:34.132 → 00:04:35.262 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_10
    That's the place Cush is right.

00:04:36.140 → 00:04:37.034 [00:00:00.894] : SPEAKER_10
    What's going on here?

00:04:37.692 → 00:04:42.873 [00:00:05.181] : SPEAKER_10
    What do you think it's called? It's called a police. You don't think it's weird? It's not cotton. Of course it's weird. It's nothing to do with us.

00:04:43.632 → 00:04:46.265 [00:00:02.633] : SPEAKER_10
    And long we don't do anything about it, then all the police gonna wonder why.

00:04:49.218 → 00:04:49.724 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_06
    Yeah.

00:04:51.867 → 00:04:52.863 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_06
    Yeah, okay.

00:04:58.583 → 00:04:59.140 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_11
    What do you do?

00:05:13.062 → 00:05:13.737 [00:00:00.675] : SPEAKER_11
    How did you...

00:05:13.400 → 00:05:16.893 [00:00:03.493] : SPEAKER_06
    We were just seeing where it was like for Cat and the Boys.

00:05:18.867 → 00:05:19.424 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_06
    Johnny.

00:05:21.517 → 00:05:21.871 [00:00:00.354] : SPEAKER_11
    No.

00:05:21.685 → 00:05:23.660 [00:00:01.974] : SPEAKER_06
    No one else has been here, is it? It's just us.

00:05:22.715 → 00:05:24.571 [00:00:01.856] : SPEAKER_11
    It was just us. It was all boarded up.

00:05:25.280 → 00:05:27.237 [00:00:01.957] : SPEAKER_06
    Charlie, what are you doing?

00:05:28.688 → 00:05:29.482 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_06
    Yes, Tacey.

00:05:32.468 → 00:05:33.076 [00:00:00.608] : SPEAKER_06
    You know.

00:05:35.843 → 00:05:36.890 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_06
    You knew he was here.

00:05:47.993 → 00:05:49.276 [00:00:01.282] : SPEAKER_09
    You can't just sit here.

00:05:50.761 → 00:05:52.499 [00:00:01.738] : SPEAKER_05
    So what Denise was like when it happened?

00:05:53.123 → 00:05:54.845 [00:00:01.721] : SPEAKER_05
    She was like the rest of us. She was in bits.

00:05:55.503 → 00:05:56.718 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_09
    But you see that all the time though.

00:05:57.528 → 00:05:59.452 [00:00:01.924] : SPEAKER_09
    People do something and then they pretend they haven't.

00:06:00.329 → 00:06:01.392 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_09
    people believe them too.

00:06:03.164 → 00:06:05.881 [00:00:02.717] : SPEAKER_05
    you're there to just march into the walk up to the nation.

00:06:05.155 → 00:06:08.632 [00:00:03.476] : SPEAKER_08
    Yes, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. But just me.

00:06:09.610 → 00:06:10.252 [00:00:00.641] : SPEAKER_08
    Not you, okay?

00:06:10.792 → 00:06:11.129 [00:00:00.338] : SPEAKER_05
    in.

00:06:12.209 → 00:06:12.968 [00:00:00.759] : SPEAKER_05
    Think about this.

00:06:13.694 → 00:06:14.690 [00:00:00.996] : SPEAKER_08
    I don't need to think about it.

00:06:15.820 → 00:06:17.002 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_08
    I'll know in a minute, I ask her.

00:06:18.098 → 00:06:19.010 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_08
    I'll see it in her eyes.

00:06:37.201 → 00:06:38.652 [00:00:01.451] : SPEAKER_11
    Ha ha ha ha!

00:06:38.652 → 00:06:38.770 [00:00:00.118] : SPEAKER_00
    Yeah.

00:06:38.770 → 00:06:38.804 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:06:39.631 → 00:06:40.019 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_10
    Thank you.

00:06:40.019 → 00:06:40.087 [00:00:00.067] : SPEAKER_11
    you

00:06:40.087 → 00:06:40.205 [00:00:00.118] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:06:51.106 → 00:06:53.840 [00:00:02.734] : SPEAKER_04
    So what do we do now? Well, you heard Ab. She's...

00:06:55.865 → 00:06:58.312 [00:00:02.447] : SPEAKER_04
    My little girl, what's happened to her?

00:06:59.628 → 00:07:01.045 [00:00:01.418] : SPEAKER_02
    what you're trying to say and what it's all my fault.

00:07:01.957 → 00:07:04.302 [00:00:02.346] : SPEAKER_04
    I didn't say that. I didn't mean that either.

00:07:08.335 → 00:07:09.753 [00:00:01.417] : SPEAKER_04
    Remember when she wanted to be over there.

00:07:32.838 → 00:07:33.260 [00:00:00.422] : SPEAKER_08
    I'm in.

00:07:33.935 → 00:07:35.217 [00:00:01.283] : SPEAKER_08
    Not now, Mike.

00:07:35.808 → 00:07:37.782 [00:00:01.974] : SPEAKER_08
    Tell Mick I'll be in a bit. We've got a problem.

00:07:41.191 → 00:07:41.765 [00:00:00.574] : SPEAKER_08
    We grew up here.

00:07:42.929 → 00:07:43.216 [00:00:00.287] : SPEAKER_08
    What?

00:07:44.178 → 00:07:44.583 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_08
    You're me.

00:07:46.591 → 00:07:47.435 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_08
    No more place.

00:07:48.869 → 00:07:49.730 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_08
    Don't move families.

00:07:52.649 → 00:07:53.358 [00:00:00.709] : SPEAKER_08
    Memoanda it.

00:07:53.358 → 00:07:53.392 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:07:55.568 → 00:07:55.585 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_08
    you

00:07:55.585 → 00:07:56.159 [00:00:00.574] : SPEAKER_10
    And I walk.

00:08:03.280 → 00:08:06.183 [00:00:02.902] : SPEAKER_10
    Five minutes. There's nothing to do with a wedding. It's done.

00:08:08.191 → 00:08:08.562 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_10
    Stop.

00:08:12.663 → 00:08:13.237 [00:00:00.574] : SPEAKER_09
    or silent.

00:08:19.396 → 00:08:19.615 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_07
    Huh?

00:08:21.387 → 00:08:22.433 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_07
    I'm gonna make it for.

00:08:22.990 → 00:08:24.155 [00:00:01.164] : SPEAKER_00
    So you can start talking.

00:08:25.471 → 00:08:26.973 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_00
    But for starters, where have you been? What have you been doing?

00:08:32.710 → 00:08:33.554 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_00
    That's a lot of money.

00:08:34.516 → 00:08:37.098 [00:00:02.582] : SPEAKER_07
    I should have been double that. I had expenses but sir.

00:08:37.638 → 00:08:39.089 [00:00:01.451] : SPEAKER_07
    I'm not going to spend any more where I come from.

00:08:39.292 → 00:08:40.152 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_00
    Plenty more of what?

00:08:40.928 → 00:08:41.755 [00:00:00.827] : SPEAKER_00
    Living like this.

00:08:42.852 → 00:08:46.058 [00:00:03.206] : SPEAKER_00
    My gut's twisting into a knot every time they'll build. Pull up on the square.

00:08:46.058 → 00:08:49.214 [00:00:03.156] : SPEAKER_07
    Oh, he didn't marry a quiet boy, Sharon, as long as that's really a shock, is it?

00:08:49.214 → 00:08:50.699 [00:00:01.485] : SPEAKER_00
    I didn't want to marry a choir boy.

00:08:50.699 → 00:08:52.994 [00:00:02.295] : SPEAKER_07
    as well because you've not exactly been an angel. I wanted to

00:08:52.403 → 00:08:54.530 [00:00:02.126] : SPEAKER_00
    I wanted to marry a man I could count on.

00:08:55.036 → 00:08:56.251 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_00
    Who'd be there for us?

00:08:58.006 → 00:09:00.217 [00:00:02.211] : SPEAKER_00
    I hate it for living like this.

00:09:01.634 → 00:09:03.575 [00:00:01.941] : SPEAKER_00
    seeing you in prison all beaten up.

00:09:04.520 → 00:09:04.975 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_07
    knowing.

00:09:05.735 → 00:09:07.017 [00:00:01.283] : SPEAKER_00
    So this time what about the next?

00:09:08.165 → 00:09:12.940 [00:00:04.776] : SPEAKER_07
    You stick to your business, okay? And I'll stick the sword out, Max and the mess you made of mine.

00:09:13.835 → 00:09:16.855 [00:00:03.021] : SPEAKER_07

00:09:16.703 → 00:09:18.577 [00:00:01.873] : SPEAKER_00
    I want you to run your businesses.

00:09:19.150 → 00:09:23.167 [00:00:04.016] : SPEAKER_00
    Do your deals. Just keep right away from the sort of stuff that's gonna put you back in the neck.

00:09:23.268 → 00:09:23.285 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_07
    you

00:09:23.285 → 00:09:24.584 [00:00:01.299] : SPEAKER_00
    Nothing about it. No Phil.

00:09:25.394 → 00:09:26.035 [00:00:00.641] : SPEAKER_00
    You do it.

00:09:27.976 → 00:09:28.364 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_00
    Oh

00:09:28.364 → 00:09:28.381 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_11

00:09:30.473 → 00:09:31.520 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_00
    I can't live like this.

00:09:32.397 → 00:09:34.490 [00:00:02.092] : SPEAKER_00
    No, I won't live like this.

00:09:35.384 → 00:09:37.223 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_00
    And if you tell me I have to, then I will walk.

00:09:37.949 → 00:09:40.632 [00:00:02.683] : SPEAKER_00
    Away from you, from the Albert, everything. We're through.

    I don't seem that surprised by all this.

00:10:04.004 → 00:10:05.759 [00:00:01.755] : SPEAKER_10

00:12:46.878 → 00:12:48.785 [00:00:01.907] : SPEAKER_00
    Who will I send it in the first place then?

00:12:49.527 → 00:12:52.700 [00:00:03.173] : SPEAKER_00

00:12:55.703 → 00:12:56.227 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_00
    This.

00:12:56.767 → 00:13:05.609 [00:00:08.842] : SPEAKER_00

    No one is looking at anyone.

00:13:09.440 → 00:13:11.279 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_10

00:13:12.680 → 00:13:14.013 [00:00:01.333] : SPEAKER_10
    if it happens here.

00:13:15.565 → 00:13:16.443 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_10
    Someone could have got in.

00:13:17.455 → 00:13:20.223 [00:00:02.768] : SPEAKER_10
    or Lucy could have met someone and they could have followed her home.

00:13:21.370 → 00:13:22.754 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_10
    Peter gets a drink of water, will you?

    You know what I'm not gonna go back that, so keep your big nose out, Ken. I've had enough of this. Whatever mistake I made, at least I realised before it was too late. What mistake? I ain't made no mistake. Oh, no, no. Of course not. You just let some loser knock you up and then run out and you're... It was for my bubbles. Oh, yeah. So just remember that when you're coming over all holier than that, because whatever mistakes I made, they ain't gonna spend a lifetime paying for them.

00:15:35.240 → 00:15:36.320 [00:00:01.080] : SPEAKER_05
    No, I'm just kidding.

00:15:40.268 → 00:15:40.893 [00:00:00.624] : SPEAKER_05
    If you know what?

00:15:40.893 → 00:15:40.910 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:15:41.365 → 00:15:42.074 [00:00:00.709] : SPEAKER_05
    Why'd you ask that?

00:15:44.150 → 00:15:46.985 [00:00:02.835] : SPEAKER_05
    You seem a bit weird or something. You seem a bit weird yourself.

00:15:46.698 → 00:15:47.018 [00:00:00.321] : SPEAKER_01
    boy.

00:15:47.018 → 00:15:47.035 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_05
    you

00:15:48.149 → 00:15:48.959 [00:00:00.810] : SPEAKER_05
    But we're getting worried.

00:15:50.900 → 00:15:51.220 [00:00:00.321] : SPEAKER_05
    There you go.

00:15:52.942 → 00:15:54.292 [00:00:01.350] : SPEAKER_12
    She deserved it, OK?

00:15:56.367 → 00:15:57.903 [00:00:01.536] : SPEAKER_12
    You have what she said to me.

00:15:59.692 → 00:16:01.244 [00:00:01.553] : SPEAKER_12
    It's got to be like the Black Bull Tunneler.

00:16:06.425 → 00:16:08.230 [00:00:01.806] : SPEAKER_12
    Yes, I'll try.

    Thank you.

00:16:22.962 → 00:16:23.030 [00:00:00.067] : SPEAKER_12
    you

00:16:23.030 → 00:16:23.722 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_09
    What's going on?

00:16:25.544 → 00:16:25.578 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_09
    you

00:16:25.578 → 00:16:25.679 [00:00:00.101] : SPEAKER_12

00:16:25.713 → 00:16:25.730 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_09
    the

00:16:25.730 → 00:16:26.236 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_12
    really needs to be.

00:16:26.236 → 00:16:27.215 [00:00:00.979] : SPEAKER_09
    You drink, don't you?

00:16:27.215 → 00:16:27.232 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_08
    you

00:16:30.134 → 00:16:30.944 [00:00:00.810] : SPEAKER_06
    So, uh...

00:16:32.159 → 00:16:33.256 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_06
    Where is the biting grip?

00:16:34.589 → 00:16:35.669 [00:00:01.080] : SPEAKER_08
    Yeah.

00:16:36.378 → 00:16:37.981 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_06
    I'll get the music cranked up a bit.

    Yeah, yeah, I'll go get him.

00:16:44.562 → 00:16:45.693 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_11
    Why do you know when you drink?

00:16:49.051 → 00:16:49.068 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_11
    you

00:16:49.068 → 00:16:49.490 [00:00:00.422] : SPEAKER_12
    Okay?

00:16:52.730 → 00:16:53.168 [00:00:00.439] : SPEAKER_12
    Okay?

00:16:58.822 → 00:17:01.387 [00:00:02.565] : SPEAKER_12
    Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

00:17:04.306 → 00:17:04.677 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_12
    Kim.

00:17:07.799 → 00:17:08.170 [00:00:00.371] : SPEAKER_12
    Kim!

00:17:09.385 → 00:17:10.128 [00:00:00.743] : SPEAKER_12
    I can't hear you.

00:17:10.972 → 00:17:11.883 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_12
    at least I tried

00:17:16.237 → 00:17:16.270 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_12
    you

00:17:16.270 → 00:17:16.810 [00:00:00.540] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh!

00:17:18.363 → 00:17:19.156 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh

00:17:19.966 → 00:17:20.033 [00:00:00.068] : SPEAKER_03
    Bye.

00:17:21.535 → 00:17:23.105 [00:00:01.569] : SPEAKER_03
    If Abby wants to come and stay, then...

00:17:22.987 → 00:17:23.577 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_04
    I'm sorry.

00:17:23.577 → 00:17:27.863 [00:00:04.286] : SPEAKER_03
    Right, I'm just saying, if Ibra and the girls do, then they know they can.

00:17:28.572 → 00:17:29.180 [00:00:00.608] : SPEAKER_03
    Where is Lauren?

00:17:31.593 → 00:17:35.204 [00:00:03.611] : SPEAKER_03
    Come on, Max. You saw Abby. She's a mess. I'm talking about she ain't a mess.

00:17:36.841 → 00:17:39.288 [00:00:02.447] : SPEAKER_04
    All right, we've seen as a mess we made already one. We did.

00:17:39.288 → 00:17:39.322 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:17:39.322 → 00:17:39.608 [00:00:00.287] : SPEAKER_04
    Wait.

00:17:40.132 → 00:17:40.857 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_04
    Yeah, you and me.

00:17:41.583 → 00:17:41.971 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_03
    Bye.

00:17:42.967 → 00:17:48.755 [00:00:05.788] : SPEAKER_03
    So I'm the one who had an affair with Stacey, am I? No, it wasn't just about that. It was Lucy as well. Seriously.

00:17:47.675 → 00:17:48.417 [00:00:00.743] : SPEAKER_04
    We want.

00:17:48.417 → 00:17:48.822 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_02
    the

00:17:48.822 → 00:17:49.936 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_03
    Can't listen up.

00:17:49.058 → 00:17:49.075 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_02
    you

00:17:49.075 → 00:17:49.953 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_04
    Can't mess it up.

00:17:49.936 → 00:17:51.893 [00:00:01.957] : SPEAKER_02
    Who's it going to be next time?

00:17:51.185 → 00:17:51.202 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:17:51.202 → 00:17:52.585 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_04
    What happened the next time, is it?

00:17:51.893 → 00:17:51.910 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:17:52.568 → 00:17:58.778 [00:00:06.210] : SPEAKER_02
    Abby was a sweet innocent little daddy's girl and she still would be now if it weren't for you and everything that you have done so don't you dare lay any of that at my door.

00:17:58.272 → 00:18:01.765 [00:00:03.493] : SPEAKER_04
    Right, do you think any of this is out? Do you ask knocking seven bells out of each other's time?

00:18:06.794 → 00:18:08.110 [00:00:01.316] : SPEAKER_03
    I didn't come here to argue.

00:18:10.304 → 00:18:11.131 [00:00:00.827] : SPEAKER_04
    So why did you come?

00:18:14.793 → 00:18:15.755 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_03
    For my best nights, I do.

00:18:16.312 → 00:18:16.852 [00:00:00.540] : SPEAKER_04
    Oh yeah.

00:18:17.476 → 00:18:17.695 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_03
    Thank you.

00:18:32.343 → 00:18:33.473 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_09
    That's right what they say then.

00:18:35.549 → 00:18:36.427 [00:00:00.877] : SPEAKER_09
    That pen is...

00:18:37.658 → 00:18:38.519 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_09
    Always turn up.

00:18:41.658 → 00:18:42.839 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_09
    I don't know why, mind you.

00:18:44.341 → 00:18:46.619 [00:00:02.278] : SPEAKER_09
    I mean, Max, he's already got one of your businesses.

00:18:47.767 → 00:18:49.623 [00:00:01.856] : SPEAKER_09
    It's only a matter of time before he gets the rest.

00:18:52.441 → 00:18:53.133 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_09
    R and R.

00:18:54.263 → 00:18:54.922 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_09
    the album.

00:18:56.474 → 00:18:58.027 [00:00:01.553] : SPEAKER_09
    maybe even the landlady.

00:18:59.225 → 00:18:59.528 [00:00:00.304] : SPEAKER_09
    Oh

00:19:00.490 → 00:19:01.368 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_09
    I struck a nerve.

00:19:03.713 → 00:19:04.844 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_09
    Not that he'd want to mind.

00:19:05.941 → 00:19:06.903 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_09
    just because he could.

00:19:07.983 → 00:19:08.708 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_09
    Bring any bells?

00:19:10.582 → 00:19:12.843 [00:00:02.261] : SPEAKER_09
    Also Max, I don't seem much

00:19:13.619 → 00:19:14.345 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_09
    Well, she proper...

00:19:15.678 → 00:19:16.775 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_09
    You lost the words to fight.

00:19:17.956 → 00:19:20.740 [00:00:02.784] : SPEAKER_09
    Yeah, or something's ain't worth fighting for, are they? What do you mean, me?

00:19:22.563 → 00:19:23.069 [00:00:00.506] : SPEAKER_09
    Oh, sure.

00:19:25.364 → 00:19:26.562 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_09
    It's just weird. That's a weird thing.

00:19:28.385 → 00:19:29.296 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_09
    seeing you out here.

00:19:30.764 → 00:19:32.030 [00:00:01.266] : SPEAKER_09
    Shouldn't you be with your wife?

00:19:52.077 → 00:19:52.499 [00:00:00.422] : SPEAKER_07
    Yeah.

00:19:52.137 → 00:19:52.559 [00:00:00.422] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah.

00:19:53.900 → 00:19:56.009 [00:00:02.109] : SPEAKER_08
    Drink this. I don't want nothing to drink.

00:19:53.960 → 00:19:56.086 [00:00:02.126] : SPEAKER_02
    Drink this. I don't want nothing to drink.

00:19:57.747 → 00:19:58.439 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_07
    Victor.

00:19:57.841 → 00:19:58.499 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_03
    Dot.

00:19:59.873 → 00:20:01.814 [00:00:01.941] : SPEAKER_07
    We've got to do something about this.

00:19:59.950 → 00:20:01.874 [00:00:01.924] : SPEAKER_03
    We've got to do something about this.

00:20:03.704 → 00:20:04.649 [00:00:00.945] : SPEAKER_08
    Tell us what happened.

00:20:03.764 → 00:20:04.726 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_02
    Tell us what happened.

00:20:07.282 → 00:20:08.260 [00:00:00.979] : SPEAKER_08
    I let him do it.

00:20:07.358 → 00:20:08.337 [00:00:00.979] : SPEAKER_02
    I let him do it.

00:20:10.623 → 00:20:10.758 [00:00:00.135] : SPEAKER_07
    with

00:20:10.683 → 00:20:10.818 [00:00:00.135] : SPEAKER_02
    with

00:20:10.910 → 00:20:11.500 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_07
    Do what?

00:20:10.970 → 00:20:11.560 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_03
    Do what?

00:20:11.500 → 00:20:11.517 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_08
    you

00:20:12.800 → 00:20:14.200 [00:00:01.401] : SPEAKER_08
    I let him take his drugs.

00:20:12.877 → 00:20:14.260 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_02
    I'll let him take his drug.

00:20:16.049 → 00:20:17.602 [00:00:01.552] : SPEAKER_02
    and then I let him die.

00:20:18.968 → 00:20:21.432 [00:00:02.464] : SPEAKER_02
    I can see from your eyes you're thinking

00:20:22.259 → 00:20:26.039 [00:00:03.780] : SPEAKER_02
    What sort of mother does that make me? Don't you sight out.

00:20:26.039 → 00:20:32.047 [00:00:06.007] : SPEAKER_00
    Don't you ever say that. You were the best mum Nick could have ever had. It's not me saying that.

00:20:32.620 → 00:20:35.624 [00:00:03.004] : SPEAKER_00
    That's what my auntie Pauline used to say, time after time and me grand.

00:20:37.227 → 00:20:39.218 [00:00:01.991] : SPEAKER_03
    Mum and parents never knew that you did it either.

00:20:40.366 → 00:20:42.070 [00:00:01.704] : SPEAKER_03
    You know, you kept stepping in and...

00:20:43.032 → 00:20:44.534 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_03
    and taken his side, but...

00:20:45.023 → 00:20:48.668 [00:00:03.645] : SPEAKER_02
    But what? You can only take so much and then you snap?

00:20:49.293 → 00:20:54.997 [00:00:05.704] : SPEAKER_02
    Yes, that's the truth. I snapped. And I didn't do it out of love.

00:20:55.520 → 00:20:59.080 [00:00:03.561] : SPEAKER_02
    Not like we there thought. I did it out of anger.

00:21:00.515 → 00:21:09.644 [00:00:09.129] : SPEAKER_02
    for all the suffering it caused. I wanted him to face judgement, I didn't want him to be released. I wanted to punish him, and I did.

00:21:11.197 → 00:21:11.416 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_02
    and

00:21:12.563 → 00:21:12.580 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_02
    You

00:21:12.580 → 00:21:13.762 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_00
    kept all this to yourself.

00:21:14.858 → 00:21:18.959 [00:00:04.101] : SPEAKER_02
    I just kept pretending it hadn't happened, you know, carrying on as normal.

00:21:19.820 → 00:21:29.000 [00:00:09.180] : SPEAKER_02
    You know, they say that you should be wary of strangers, but it's the ones you love who hurt you the most, and you hurt the ones that love you the most too.

00:21:30.535 → 00:21:31.767 [00:00:01.232] : SPEAKER_02
    Nick was my test.

00:21:32.797 → 00:21:33.910 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_02
    and I failed it.

00:21:34.619 → 00:21:38.197 [00:00:03.577] : SPEAKER_02
    I failed him in his life, and I failed him in his death.

00:21:38.855 → 00:21:42.027 [00:00:03.172] : SPEAKER_02
    and I needed to tell someone.

00:21:42.685 → 00:21:43.478 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_02
    And now...

00:21:44.997 → 00:21:45.925 [00:00:00.928] : SPEAKER_02

00:22:27.168 → 00:22:27.944 [00:00:00.776] : SPEAKER_06
    No.

00:24:32.110 → 00:24:34.118 [00:00:02.008] : SPEAKER_03
    Well, she didn't pull a gun on him or nothing, but...

00:24:35.182 → 00:24:37.257 [00:00:02.076] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah, it seems he took some drugs and...

00:24:38.185 → 00:24:39.788 [00:00:01.603] : SPEAKER_03
    He had an attack or something and...

00:24:41.172 → 00:24:41.965 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_03
    Well, she let him die.

00:24:41.965 → 00:24:42.083 [00:00:00.118] : SPEAKER_07
    I

00:24:43.349 → 00:24:46.555 [00:00:03.206] : SPEAKER_07
    So what do we do? What we should have done half an hour ago. We called the police.

00:24:47.230 → 00:24:47.939 [00:00:00.709] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah, and then what?

00:24:48.496 → 00:24:52.630 [00:00:04.134] : SPEAKER_03
    I mean, the state dot Simran now, she's gonna say the same thing to them, that it was all down to her.

00:24:53.423 → 00:24:54.824 [00:00:01.401] : SPEAKER_07
    Oh, that's what you're saying.

00:24:56.090 → 00:24:57.946 [00:00:01.856] : SPEAKER_03
    Well, I'm saying that we know.

00:24:58.553 → 00:25:04.966 [00:00:06.412] : SPEAKER_03
    She knows there's no reason for anyone else to find out though, is there? We can't actually pretend it ain't happened. Come on in, it's not her fault, not really.

00:25:04.966 → 00:25:06.805 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_07
    You still ain't got anything to do with us, has it? Exactly.

00:25:07.514 → 00:25:08.611 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_07
    Right, so we can all just forget it.

00:25:09.185 → 00:25:09.657 [00:00:00.473] : SPEAKER_07
    No.

00:25:10.518 → 00:25:12.239 [00:00:01.721] : SPEAKER_07
    Yeah, I'm sorry for that. Of course I am.

00:25:12.897 → 00:25:14.281 [00:00:01.384] : SPEAKER_07
    If you're saying what I think you're saying.

00:25:15.125 → 00:25:16.627 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_07
    We're gonna be in this right up to our necks.

    Why should I?

00:25:26.667 → 00:25:27.815 [00:00:01.147] : SPEAKER_03
    If we all agree it hasn't happened.

00:25:28.270 → 00:25:30.920 [00:00:02.649] : SPEAKER_07
    Well that ain't gonna stop Dot saying it, has it? She can say what she wants.

00:25:31.544 → 00:25:33.772 [00:00:02.227] : SPEAKER_07
    If the police can't find the body, it don't make much difference, does it?

00:25:36.877 → 00:25:37.838 [00:00:00.962] : SPEAKER_07
    She's an old lady, I suppose.

00:25:39.610 → 00:25:42.378 [00:00:02.767] : SPEAKER_03
    Yeah, they'll just say that she's wondering in the hate or something.

00:25:42.901 → 00:25:44.740 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_07
    So you're saying? We're saying.

00:26:10.981 → 00:26:14.305 [00:00:03.324] : SPEAKER_04

00:28:15.080 → 00:28:17.476 [00:00:02.396] : SPEAKER_00
    Why would he turn up in the first place if he was just gonna go off again?

00:28:20.969 → 00:28:21.442 [00:00:00.473] : SPEAKER_00
    No, well.

00:28:23.365 → 00:28:24.074 [00:00:00.709] : SPEAKER_00
    Maybe you'll want it.

00:28:54.550 → 00:28:54.618 [00:00:00.067] : SPEAKER_06
    you

00:28:54.618 → 00:29:01.250 [00:00:06.632] : SPEAKER_05
    Come on. Come on. OK, the ambulance say they're on their way.

00:28:59.107 → 00:29:00.170 [00:00:01.063] : SPEAKER_00
    Okay, the endless...

00:29:01.385 → 00:29:05.435 [00:00:04.050] : SPEAKER_05
    They're on the way! They need to be here now! Yeah, but that's how we have to stay on the phone here!

00:29:06.076 → 00:29:10.025 [00:00:03.949] : SPEAKER_05
    I think it's not the time for little cogs to chat with an ambulance!

00:29:10.025 → 00:29:10.852 [00:00:00.827] : SPEAKER_06
    What do you think of him?

00:29:10.852 → 00:29:10.868 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_05
    you

00:29:11.375 → 00:29:11.392 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_05

00:29:11.392 → 00:29:15.087 [00:00:03.696] : SPEAKER_06

    Anyway, so

00:29:27.035 → 00:29:41.767 [00:00:14.732] : SPEAKER_06
    I do all people not babies. What they say now? What they say we got a layer on a side. What? Which side? The left, the left side. And they say we got to get something warm and try some towels or something.

00:29:37.042 → 00:29:38.408 [00:00:01.367] : SPEAKER_05
    Come on, Kelly!

00:29:42.239 → 00:29:42.897 [00:00:00.658] : SPEAKER_05

    Bye.

00:29:42.965 → 00:29:44.804 [00:00:01.839] : SPEAKER_05
    Just in time

00:29:44.146 → 00:29:45.344 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_06
    Just in case.

00:29:45.344 → 00:29:46.458 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_05
    No!

00:29:45.438 → 00:29:45.725 [00:00:00.287] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh!

00:29:45.725 → 00:29:45.792 [00:00:00.068] : SPEAKER_04

00:29:45.792 → 00:29:48.003 [00:00:02.211] : SPEAKER_03
    No, no, no, no, no.

00:29:46.964 → 00:29:48.871 [00:00:01.907] : SPEAKER_05
    Oh

00:29:48.003 → 00:29:48.830 [00:00:00.827] : SPEAKER_10
    I

00:29:51.057 → 00:29:53.360 [00:00:02.303] : SPEAKER_01
    I'm really not sure about this.

00:29:52.998 → 00:29:54.753 [00:00:01.755] : SPEAKER_10
    Yeah, well, it never bothered you last time.

00:29:53.056 → 00:29:54.811 [00:00:01.755] : SPEAKER_06
    Yeah, well it never bothered you last time.

00:29:54.837 → 00:30:06.758 [00:00:11.921] : SPEAKER_01
    Last time we were pretending he was dead. You were? This isn't pretending, this is covering up! What's the difference? Oh, about five years. What did he say? If anyone had found out about the first, we'd have probably got a slap on the wrist. Diz!

00:30:06.683 → 00:30:08.911 [00:00:02.227] : SPEAKER_10
    Well, no one's gonna find out about this, though, are they?

00:30:06.758 → 00:30:08.868 [00:00:02.109] : SPEAKER_06
    Well, no one's gonna find out about this, though, are they?

00:30:08.868 → 00:30:10.447 [00:00:01.579] : SPEAKER_01
    like plenty of people already have.

00:30:11.459 → 00:30:12.033 [00:00:00.574] : SPEAKER_10
    Yeah, cool.

00:30:11.517 → 00:30:12.074 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_06
    Yeah, cool.

00:30:12.185 → 00:30:13.670 [00:00:01.485] : SPEAKER_10
    They're all gonna keep their mouth shut.

00:30:12.226 → 00:30:13.728 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_06
    They're all going to keep their mouth shut.

00:30:15.188 → 00:30:16.387 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_10
    So there's no problem, is there?

00:30:20.116 → 00:30:20.133 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_10
    you

00:30:20.133 → 00:30:23.609 [00:00:03.476] : SPEAKER_00
    Right, now that's sorted. Let's leave this to Les and the family.

00:30:24.470 → 00:30:26.174 [00:00:01.704] : SPEAKER_00
    Let the rest of us get back to the party, shall we?

00:30:32.536 → 00:30:32.890 [00:00:00.354] : SPEAKER_00
    Alright.

00:30:33.937 → 00:30:34.628 [00:00:00.692] : SPEAKER_00
    Come on, you.

00:30:35.202 → 00:30:36.451 [00:00:01.249] : SPEAKER_00
    You've got a wedding to get back to.

00:30:37.227 → 00:30:38.712 [00:00:01.485] : SPEAKER_00
    General thinks she's been dumped to something.

00:30:40.754 → 00:30:42.425 [00:00:01.671] : SPEAKER_07
    I'm just gonna hang around here for a bit.

    I'm full.

00:30:57.022 → 00:30:58.034 [00:00:01.013] : SPEAKER_06

00:30:58.034 → 00:30:58.962 [00:00:00.928] : SPEAKER_07
    smile you got in your face.

00:30:59.637 → 00:31:01.730 [00:00:02.092] : SPEAKER_04

00:31:02.894 → 00:31:03.620 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_04
    Tie in the knot.

00:31:03.620 → 00:31:03.637 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_05

00:31:06.809 → 00:31:07.788 [00:00:00.979] : SPEAKER_05
    At least I'm not bad.

00:31:08.092 → 00:31:14.538 [00:00:06.446] : SPEAKER_07
    It's not a young animal to be ugly. Best we stop there.

00:31:15.162 → 00:31:26.232 [00:00:11.070] : SPEAKER_05
    We need some towels. Someone had an accident. Out in water, hot water. And can you stick a sign on the car to the door to stop anyone coming in? What? Saying what? Closed. Due to childbirth.

00:31:26.232 → 00:31:26.992 [00:00:00.759] : SPEAKER_02

00:33:07.263 → 00:33:13.490 [00:00:06.227] : SPEAKER_13
    Look at the state he was freezing! I feel alright! I wonder if you could feel anything if you drank all that!

00:33:13.490 → 00:33:15.177 [00:00:01.688] : SPEAKER_08
    I'm not even watching it spill on a bench anyway.

00:33:15.413 → 00:33:19.868 [00:00:04.455] : SPEAKER_13

00:33:21.337 → 00:33:29.555 [00:00:08.218] : SPEAKER_13
    Don't do it. Don't kick off. Just have a couple of drinks. Toast a happy couple. Go home.

00:33:34.060 → 00:33:37.756 [00:00:03.696] : SPEAKER_13
    Still, I gave your Mrs Wat for so the night won't completely waste it.

    You're going to take him away. It's OK. We've worked out what we're going to do. Yeah?

00:34:03.997 → 00:34:05.195 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_07
    You're not gonna get in any trouble.

00:34:05.195 → 00:34:06.832 [00:00:01.637] : SPEAKER_09
    Just do what we say.

00:34:07.878 → 00:34:12.097 [00:00:04.219] : SPEAKER_09

00:34:18.307 → 00:34:18.458 [00:00:00.152] : SPEAKER_09
    You

00:34:23.639 → 00:34:24.668 [00:00:01.029] : SPEAKER_03
    That is tough!

00:34:27.368 → 00:34:40.531 [00:00:13.162] : SPEAKER_04
    Yes. And they're saying if anything does happen... Going to never mind, dear. We've got to make sure we don't lie the baby on the floor because it has to be kept warm for the moment. This baby's too much for me. It's going to be linky-batter. They're saying we've got to lie the baby on Kim.

00:34:30.355 → 00:34:31.925 [00:00:01.569] : SPEAKER_00
    I'm going to never mind this!

00:34:35.705 → 00:34:36.565 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_00
    It's mine, honey.

00:50:52.735 → 00:50:52.769 [00:00:00.034] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:50:52.769 → 00:50:53.225 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_00
    So

00:50:53.225 → 00:50:53.765 [00:00:00.540] : SPEAKER_01
    It's okay.

00:50:53.765 → 00:50:54.035 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_00
    you

00:50:54.035 → 00:50:55.250 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_01
    Just relax.

00:50:55.250 → 00:50:55.739 [00:00:00.489] : SPEAKER_00
    Relax.

00:50:56.195 → 00:50:56.212 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:50:57.730 → 00:51:00.616 [00:00:02.886] : SPEAKER_03
    Oh no, no, no, no, don't do this.

00:51:03.164 → 00:51:04.649 [00:00:01.485] : SPEAKER_01
    Dad! Dad!

00:51:14.926 → 00:51:15.415 [00:00:00.489] : SPEAKER_01
    We do it.

00:51:16.732 → 00:51:17.356 [00:00:00.624] : SPEAKER_01
    Stay back.

00:51:17.525 → 00:51:19.027 [00:00:01.502] : SPEAKER_03
    Then there's a pub full of people.

00:51:19.027 → 00:51:22.469 [00:00:03.443] : SPEAKER_01
    You know, you've got an alarm, haven't you? They'll get plenty of warning.

00:51:23.009 → 00:51:28.527 [00:00:05.518] : SPEAKER_01
    It's your pub, I won't let your punters. I'm not a madman and I'm not your slapper of a wife called me either.

00:51:28.156 → 00:51:29.270 [00:00:01.114] : SPEAKER_00
    That'd be stupid.

00:51:31.666 → 00:51:32.054 [00:00:00.388] : SPEAKER_01
    that you

00:51:33.657 → 00:51:34.838 [00:00:01.181] : SPEAKER_01
    You can go if you want, then.

00:51:37.555 → 00:51:37.825 [00:00:00.270] : SPEAKER_01
    No.

00:51:38.332 → 00:51:39.462 [00:00:01.131] : SPEAKER_01
    They make your dad sell this out.

00:51:40.002 → 00:51:40.897 [00:00:00.894] : SPEAKER_01
    Got no argument with you.

00:51:41.268 → 00:51:41.977 [00:00:00.709] : SPEAKER_00
    Then she's right.

00:51:43.647 → 00:51:44.693 [00:00:01.046] : SPEAKER_00
    You ain't got a clue what you're doing.

00:51:45.301 → 00:51:49.250 [00:00:03.949] : SPEAKER_01
    And Nancy was right from the off. You see, Nancy knew there was something going on between me and Linda.

00:51:52.000 → 00:51:53.030 [00:00:01.029] : SPEAKER_01
    You know, out of life.

00:51:53.671 → 00:51:54.262 [00:00:00.591] : SPEAKER_01
    Before her.

00:51:57.012 → 00:51:57.923 [00:00:00.911] : SPEAKER_01
    I had a family.

00:51:59.476 → 00:51:59.948 [00:00:00.472] : SPEAKER_01
    Home.

00:52:01.585 → 00:52:03.982 [00:00:02.396] : SPEAKER_01
    And she took it all away from me. She took it all.

00:52:05.382 → 00:52:06.530 [00:00:01.148] : SPEAKER_01
    I'm not a rapist, though.

00:52:07.357 → 00:52:08.234 [00:00:00.878] : SPEAKER_01
    Just an arsonist.

00:52:09.162 → 00:52:11.474 [00:00:02.312] : SPEAKER_01
    or anything I'm doing, you've made me do.

00:52:12.554 → 00:52:14.343 [00:00:01.789] : SPEAKER_00
    Just like Linda, when she lets you on.

00:52:15.440 → 00:52:16.655 [00:00:01.215] : SPEAKER_00
    Wasn't your fault, Naver, was it?

00:52:16.807 → 00:52:16.992 [00:00:00.186] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:52:18.089 → 00:52:18.562 [00:00:00.473] : SPEAKER_01
    You're welcome.

00:52:18.865 → 00:52:19.793 [00:00:00.928] : SPEAKER_00
    Nothing ever is.

00:52:24.603 → 00:52:25.396 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_01
    You scared me.

00:52:25.598 → 00:52:25.615 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_00
    you

00:52:25.615 → 00:52:25.919 [00:00:00.304] : SPEAKER_01
    not.

00:52:27.742 → 00:52:30.037 [00:00:02.295] : SPEAKER_01
    You're the one who's scared. No, I'm not scared of anyone.

00:52:31.505 → 00:52:35.909 [00:00:04.404] : SPEAKER_01
    You just remember I did you a favor by sleeping with her. I opened your eyes.

00:52:35.909 → 00:52:36.348 [00:00:00.439] : SPEAKER_03
    Thanks.

00:52:37.360 → 00:52:38.980 [00:00:01.620] : SPEAKER_03
    You know your mum's through there, don't you?

00:52:44.515 → 00:52:45.764 [00:00:01.249] : SPEAKER_00
    You shut your mouth.

00:52:48.127 → 00:52:48.886 [00:00:00.759] : SPEAKER_00
    That's what you do it.

00:52:49.831 → 00:52:51.097 [00:00:01.266] : SPEAKER_00
    Daddy's not breathing!

00:52:56.800 → 00:52:57.593 [00:00:00.793] : SPEAKER_01
    Dad!

00:53:50.142 → 00:53:50.665 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_03
    It's me.

00:53:53.450 → 00:53:53.888 [00:00:00.439] : SPEAKER_03
    I know.

00:53:56.302 → 00:53:56.943 [00:00:00.641] : SPEAKER_03
    I know.

00:54:00.250 → 00:54:01.094 [00:00:00.844] : SPEAKER_03
    You killed Lucy.

00:54:03.136 → 00:54:04.300 [00:00:01.164] : SPEAKER_03
    Get everyone out the house.

00:54:06.832 → 00:54:07.557 [00:00:00.726] : SPEAKER_03
    I'm coming home.

00:54:20.467 → 00:54:20.686 [00:00:00.219] : SPEAKER_02
    Hey!

00:54:23.116 → 00:54:23.521 [00:00:00.405] : SPEAKER_01
    Charlie!

00:54:25.073 → 00:54:25.630 [00:00:00.557] : SPEAKER_01
    What's happened?

00:54:31.351 → 00:54:31.368 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_01
    you

00:54:31.368 → 00:54:32.228 [00:00:00.861] : SPEAKER_03
    Goodbye.

00:54:33.916 → 00:54:34.372 [00:00:00.456] : SPEAKER_03
    No.

00:54:38.135 → 00:54:38.287 [00:00:00.152] : SPEAKER_00
    the

00:55:33.603 → 00:55:34.801 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_02
    Tell me exactly.

00:55:35.712 → 00:55:36.809 [00:00:01.097] : SPEAKER_02
    What happened that night?

00:56:31.265 → 00:56:33.205 [00:00:01.941] : SPEAKER_03
    The gospel dark is alive.

00:56:34.572 → 00:56:36.462 [00:00:01.890] : SPEAKER_03
    Who doesn't break a man, makes a man?

00:56:37.559 → 00:56:37.627 [00:00:00.068] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:56:37.627 → 00:56:49.186 [00:00:11.559] : SPEAKER_01
    My body is to be married. Who's it to be Elizabeth?

00:56:52.493 → 00:56:57.708 [00:00:05.214] : SPEAKER_01
    What's your name? Demel the card. Rustpal doc.

00:56:58.805 → 00:57:00.003 [00:00:01.198] : SPEAKER_01
    People save us.

00:57:00.796 → 00:57:03.344 [00:00:02.548] : SPEAKER_01
    Your place is here. Your land, your mind.

00:57:03.428 → 00:57:03.445 [00:00:00.017] : SPEAKER_03
    you

00:57:03.445 → 00:57:03.968 [00:00:00.523] : SPEAKER_01
    Where did you see that?

00:57:03.968 → 00:57:08.272 [00:00:04.303] : SPEAKER_03
    I think I was going.
